      Based on this chat message: "${query}" and the current topic "${context}",
      generate 3 engaging, educational blocks that are DIRECTLY RELATED to the current topic.
      Previous response for context: "${previous_response}"

      IMPORTANT FORMATTING AND CONTEXT RULES:
      1. Each block must be EXACTLY ONE LINE of clickbait-style content
      2. Each line MUST be EXACTLY 75 CHARACTERS or LESS (including spaces and emoji)
      3. Each line MUST:
         - Start with "Did you know" or an exciting question
         - Include ONE fascinating fact DIRECTLY RELATED to the current topic
         - End with ONE relevant emoji
         - Be engaging and fun for kids
         - Make them want to click to learn more
      4. MAINTAIN TOPIC RELEVANCE:
         - Each block must be a natural continuation of the current topic
         - Focus on related subtopics that expand on the current discussion
         - Ensure a logical connection between blocks

      Example perfect blocks for "planets":
      - "Did you know Mars has the biggest volcano in our solar system? Let's explore it! üåã"
      - "Want to see why Saturn's rings are disappearing? Time to blast off! üöÄ"
      - "Can you believe Venus spins backwards? Let's find out why! ‚≠ê"

      Format the response as a JSON object with this structure:
      {
        "blocks": [
          {
            "title": "Single line of exactly 75 chars or less with emoji",
            "metadata": {
              "topic": "specific_subtopic_related_to_context"
            }
          }
        ]
      }

      CRITICAL: 
      - Double-check that each title is 75 characters or less INCLUDING the emoji!
      - Ensure each block is directly related to the current topic!
      - Build upon the previous response to maintain conversation flow!

    Format as a valid JSON object with a 'blocks' array containing objects with 'title' and 'metadata'.
    Each block must be under 70 characters and include an emoji.
    
    Example format:
    {
      "blocks": [
        {
          "title": "ðŸŒŸ Fun fact about space",
          "metadata": {
            "topic": "space",
            "type": "fact"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    
    Ensure the response is ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
